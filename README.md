# Color Schemes
Great color schemes for terminals and general text themes.
these colors have beed carefully chosen by an artist **my wife**, and are meant for long exposures to text and screen. Also helps if you are bored of the popular themes and/or are looking for a fresh take on terminal esthetics.

## How to use
these schemes are in terminator config file format.
you can copy the palette from it to use elsewhere as well.

# Font Recommendation:
you can download the font from following link. to work best with these schemes ...

# Background Image recommendation
I have created a background image specifically for the following color themes:

* Tweed Jacket
* Goldy locks

#### Other themes dont need a backgound image in my opinion and work best on solid black ground.

## I never use white background in terminal, or in general. So the themes here are only for dark background.

Hope you enjoy!
cheers
